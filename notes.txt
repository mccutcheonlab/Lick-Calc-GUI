To make into executable

install pyinstaller (pip install pyinstaller) )installed into lickcalc environment
navigate to appropriate directory and run
pyinstaller lickcalcGUI.py

try this first to see if it works

then to make single file and windowed run

pyinstaller --onefile --windowed lickcalcGUI

may not want --onefile or --windowed options as they take longer to load.

maybe best option is --onefile but NOT --windowed so that at least the console window pops up

--icon='iconfile.ico'

***
Use this line to make .exe, file will be in dist folder

pyinstaller --onefile --icon=lickcalc-Icon.ico lickcalcGUI.py
