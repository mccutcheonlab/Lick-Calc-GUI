***Notes on creating executable file with pyinstaller***

install pyinstaller (pip install pyinstaller) )installed into lickcalc environment
navigate to appropriate directory and run
pyinstaller lickcalcGUI.py

try this first to see if it works

then to make single file and windowed run

pyinstaller --onefile --windowed lickcalcGUI

may not want --onefile or --windowed options as they take longer to load.

maybe best option is --onefile but NOT --windowed so that at least the console window pops up

--icon='iconfile.ico'

***
Use this line to make .exe, file will be in dist folder

pyinstaller --onefile --icon=lickcalc-Icon.ico lickcalcGUI.py

***Notes on installing environment and running from command line***

Install Anaconda
Create environment using 'conda env create -f environment.yml'
Activate environment using 'conda activate lickcalc13'
Run GUI using 'python lickcalcGUI.py'


***Notes on environments for development***
Change first line of environment.yml to create newly-named environment (e.g. lickcalc14dev)
Install additional programs as required (e.g. spyder and other packages)
When GUI is ready for release, attempt creating new environment using e.g 'conda create -n lickcalc14 python=3.7 numpy matplotlib scipy xlsxwriter'
Try running GUI using 'python lickcalcGUI.py'
If it works, write to environment.yml file (conda env export > environment.yml)
Then, install pyinstaller using 'pip install pyinstaller' and follow instructions above to make .exe
